Below are a few example prompts you can provide to a code generation LLM. Each prompt is designed to instruct the model to generate code (or configuration files) that implements secure code signing best practices combined with robust release engineering practices.

**Prompt 1: CI/CD Pipeline with Integrated Code Signing**

*“Generate a YAML configuration for a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., a GitHub Actions workflow) that performs the following steps:

- Checks out the source code from Git.
- Runs unit, integration, and security tests.
- Builds a reproducible binary package ensuring hermetic builds.
- Generates a unique build identifier (using Semantic Versioning).
- Automatically signs the final build artifact using a secure code signing process that incorporates the following best practices:
  - Uses a separate release-signing key stored in a Hardware Security Module (HSM) (simulate this by calling an external signing service function).
  - Includes a time-stamp in the signature.
  - Logs all signing activities for audit purposes.
- Pushes the signed artifact to an artifact repository.
  
Ensure that the configuration is modular so that the signing steps can be swapped out or extended, and include comments explaining each stage. Use secret-management best practices (e.g., reference secrets from environment variables rather than embedding them directly).”*

**Prompt 2: Secure Code Signing Script in Python**

*“Write a Python script that implements a secure code signing function for build artifacts. The script should:

1. Read an artifact (e.g., a .zip file) and compute its cryptographic hash.
2. Perform a virus/malware scan on the artifact before signing.
3. Retrieve a signing key from a secure storage system (simulate this as a function that returns a key from an HSM, ensuring that the key is never exposed).
4. Digitally sign the artifact’s hash using the signing key, and include a trusted timestamp obtained from a timestamping service.
5. Log all signing operations (including the artifact name, build identifier, and timestamp) to a secure log file.
6. Differentiate between test-signing and release-signing modes based on a command-line flag (e.g., `--mode test` vs. `--mode release`).

Include error handling for key retrieval failures, virus scan failures, and signing errors, and comment your code extensively.”*

**Prompt 3: Artifact Packaging and Versioning Script**

*“Develop a script (in a language of your choice, e.g., Python) that automates the packaging of software releases. The script should:

- Read the current version from a configuration file and increment it following Semantic Versioning rules.
- Build the artifact (simulate a build process by packaging files into a zip archive).
- Generate a checksum (e.g., SHA-256 hash) for the build.
- Integrate with the secure code signing script (from Prompt 2) to sign the artifact.
- Save the signed artifact along with its checksum and version metadata into a structured artifact repository (simulate this with file system directories organized by version).
- Output release notes summarizing the version, signing timestamp, and any encountered warnings or errors.

Ensure your script allows for extensibility (e.g., later replacing the packaging method, incorporating additional metadata, or integrating with a cloud artifact storage system). Provide detailed comments and usage instructions.”*

**Prompt 4: Comprehensive Release Build Script with Security Gate**

*“Generate a Bash (or Python) script that ties together multiple steps of a secure release process. The script should:

1. Pull the latest code from a version-controlled repository.
2. Run a suite of automated tests.
3. Build the software artifact in a reproducible manner.
4. Perform virus/malware scanning on the build output.
5. Call an external Python code-signing utility (see Prompt 2) to digitally sign the artifact, ensuring that the signing process uses an HSM-protected key and appends a timestamp.
6. Log all operations (build start/end times, test results, virus scan status, signing success/failure, and timestamp) to a centralized audit log.
7. Handle errors gracefully (if tests fail, virus scan fails, or signing fails, the script should exit and report the problem).
8. Support configurable parameters via command-line arguments (such as specifying the build mode, version bump type, or artifact output directory).

Include comments and instructions that help a user integrate this script into a larger CI/CD system, ensuring it’s production ready.”*

Each of these prompts is self-contained and directs a code generation LLM to produce code for various parts of a secure release engineering and code signing process. You can adapt the prompts or combine elements of them to match the specifics of your technology stack and organizational requirements.
