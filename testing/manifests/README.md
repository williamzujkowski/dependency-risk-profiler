# Test Manifest Files

This directory contains minimal dependency manifest files for testing with different ecosystems:

- Python (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml)
- Node.js (package.json, package-lock.json)
- Go (go.mod)

These files are used to test the parsing and analysis functionality of the Dependency Risk Profiler.
