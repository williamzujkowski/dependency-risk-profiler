## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-01

### Changed

- **Scoring: the `maintained` signal now has its own tunable weight**
  (`maintained_weight`, default `0.20`). It previously reused
  `branch_protection_weight`, so the two OpenSSF Scorecard-inspired signals
  could not be tuned independently. Because this is a behavior-changing scoring
  default, **risk scores may shift for packages that expose both a
  branch-protection signal and a maintained signal.** The weight is wired
  through the config layer symmetrically with the other weights
  (`scoring_weights.maintained`).

### Fixed

- **Version-difference scoring no longer misclassifies hyphenated prereleases.**
  Installed versions containing `-` (for example `1.2.3-rc1` or Go pseudo-versions)
  were short-circuited to a flat `0.25` "version range" score. They are now parsed
  by real version distance, so a `2.0.0-beta` that is two majors behind scores as
  the major-version risk it actually is.
- **Staleness is now computed in UTC.** The last-updated timestamp is normalized
  to UTC (naive timestamps are assumed to be UTC) and compared against
  `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`, so staleness no longer varies with the host's
  local time zone.
